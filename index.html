        Hi. My name is Bhumika Bakhariya and this is my second year at WSU.
        I am a computer science major and originally from Nepal. I love music and painting.
        I also love to explore cultures, foods and lifestyles from around the world.
        I might seem like a boring person to you at first but trust me, when you get to
        know me, I turn out to be a fun being. For all the 21 years I have spent on this earth,
        I have absolutely no regrets and I love my life, my family and my friends.
